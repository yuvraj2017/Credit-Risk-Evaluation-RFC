# Loan Risk Classification Project

## Background

Lending services companies provide opportunities for individual investors to partially fund personal loans and trade notes backing these loans on a secondary market. In this project, we aim to classify the risk levels associated with loans using machine learning models.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to compare the performance of two machine learning models for classifying loan risk levels:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

## Data

The dataset used for this project is `lending_data.csv`, which contains features related to loans and their risk levels.

## Workflow

1. **Retrieve the Data**

   The dataset is available in the Challenge Files Folder under the filename `lending_data.csv`. 

2. **Model Consideration**

   We evaluate two models:
   - **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model used for binary classification.
   - **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results.

3. **Model Fitting and Evaluation**

   - **Logistic Regression**: Fit the model to the data and evaluate its performance. Assess the accuracy score and the confusion matrix.
   - **Random Forest Classifier**: Train the model and evaluate its performance similarly. Compare the accuracy score and confusion matrix with the Logistic Regression model.

4. **Comparison and Insights**

   Compare the performance of both models based on their accuracy scores and confusion matrices. Document the results and insights gained from the comparison, including any observations about which model performs better and why.

## Methods Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Train-Test Split**: For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification of loan risk.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: For ensemble classification of loan risk.
- **Standard Scaler**: For feature scaling to standardize the dataset.
- **Confusion Matrix**: For evaluating model performance.
